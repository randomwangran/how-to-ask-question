# why asking question make people unhappy and how to avoid such thing from a Emacs user perspective?

> 你可以不同意，但是要理解世界上有一些人是这样想的。 --海龙

I would like to know how people think.


# examples



I once talk to people. When I try to take an example, I forget to tell him this is not the thing that I test. The aim is to show the idea. Guess what?

>  YOU MUST BE LYING

I had nothing to say.

Even no chance to clarify. Before the post was deleted, before I know this post will be deleted.

So, I feel that many people do not have the patient to talk to you.

So, I need to study what they are thinking. 

And try to avoid such thing. Next time I talk to them.
